# Top 10 Programming languages to learn in 2022

Programming has become a very important skill for every programmer. There are lots of programming languages out there, each with its own unique features. Which one should you choose in 2022?

## 1. Python

Python is a programming language that has become very popular over the years. It is widely used in scientific research, data analysis and machine learning. What makes it so special?

Python was created by Guido van Rossum at AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1979. He wanted to create a simple scripting language that would be easy to read and write. The language was named after Monty Python Flying Circus because he thought it sounded cool. Since then, Python has grown into a powerful tool for programmers around the world.

There are several reasons why Python is such a great programming language. For starters, it is open source, meaning anyone can access its code and improve upon it. Also, Python is free from licensing fees, allowing developers to focus on their projects without having to worry about paying royalties. Finally, Python is highly versatile and can be used for almost anything.

## 2. Java

Java is a programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. The language was initially released in 1995, and has since evolved into a robust and widely used software development tool.

Java is a general purpose object oriented programming language. It supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, functional, object-oriented, and imperative. As a result, Java is often used for web applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, server side scripting, embedded systems, game development, etc.

Java is a powerful programming language that offers a wide range of features and tools. If you want to build a scalable application or create a secure system, then Java is the perfect choice.

## 3. Javascript

Javascript is a programming language that allows web developers to create interactive websites. What exactly is it?

Javascript is a scripting language that was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation (now part of Mozilla) in 1995. The name comes from JavaScript: The Language, which was released in 1994.
